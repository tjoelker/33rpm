# 33rpm Project
Often you hear, music on vinyl sounds better. There's no denying that, but what fascinates me about it is the dynamic behaviour. It feels hypnotic to see vinyl spin. Hence why I want to make everything spin. By using YouTube's iFrame player API I developed a website where you can make every YouTube video spin like vinyl.
